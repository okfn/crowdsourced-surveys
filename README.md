## Overview

This project is a prototype built to assist crowdsourcing of data about schools
in Tanzania. It is built oin top of Ushahidi, a crowdsourcing platform, and has 
some extra glue / management code to hold it all together and automate things as 
much as possible.

Here are some relevant links for the Tanzania schools crowdsourcing project:

* [The Ushahidi API](https://crowdsurvey-api.herokuapp.com) instance we used
* [The Ushahidi web client](https://crowdsurvey.herokuapp.com)
* [An embedded form](https://tz-schools.oklabs.org/) created to simplify crowd's 
interaction with us (hosted on GitHub Pages, code is in 
[the `gh-pages` branch](https://github.com/okfn/crowdsourced-surveys/tree/gh-pages)
* [This GitHub repository](https://github.com/okfn/crowdsourced-surveys/)
